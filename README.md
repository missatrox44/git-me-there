## Description
Git Me There was created for users to plan their transportation needs for upcoming trips. A user simply types in the location of any U.S. city and will be given a walking score, biking score, and restaurants nearby. If the walking score is below 50, a link to reserve a ride with Uber will appear.

## Concept
The concept for Git Me There came about when one of our team members took an ill-fated trip to Ibiza. He spent €300 on a rental car for 3 days, thinking it was necessary. He soon found out he could walk everywhere. He later said, “It was more inconvenient to have the car than if I just walked around.”

We wanted to build on this concept by adding information about local restaurants and potential lodging and local attractions. A traveler could visit Git Me There, type in any city, and after a few moments be given some of this information.
